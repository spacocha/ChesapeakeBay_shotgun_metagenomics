# ChesapeakeBay_shotgun_metagenomics
Scripts and pipeline associated with the shotgun metagenomic analysis of samples from 2017 in the Chesapeake Bay.
Designed for use by Preheim Lab members with accounts on MARCC and Rockfish clusters.

Folders in scripts are numbered by the order in which they are performed.
Each folder has an associated README.txt file which provides further guidance about how to run the analysis.
The README.txt files are not meant to be executable, although they might look similar to bash scripts.
